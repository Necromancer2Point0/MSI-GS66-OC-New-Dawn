Misc info on how to swap to applealc

Description: user Phu54321 reports that VoodooHDA is incompatible with Big Sur 11.3+ out of the box and that applealc is preferred in such cases. However, some tweaks are needed to ensure both the headphone jack and speakers produce audio without distortion.

Solution: set applealc to layout-id=16, 10000000 in pci settings
